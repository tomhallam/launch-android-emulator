# Launch an Android emulator

Launch an Android emulator for React Native development.

Tested on my Mac so far.

## Usage

Auto detect the first configured emulator and launch it:

```
npx launch-android-emulator
```

Launch a named emulator:

```
npx launch-android-emulator --name Pixel_3a_API_29_x86
```
